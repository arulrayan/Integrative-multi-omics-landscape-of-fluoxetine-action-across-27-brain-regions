# Integrative-multi-omics-landscape-of-fluoxetine-action-across-27-brain-regions

In our study we generated and analysed profile of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq of Rat brain with and without treatment an anti-depressant drug. 

This github repository consist of codes and possibly smaller data-files used for analysis of bulk RNA-seq, bulk CHiP-seq profiles of 27 regions of Rat Brain.
it also contains codes for analysis of and single-cell RNA-seq profiles from two Rat brain regions.

The larger files like wiggle tracks, vstep files and bam files cannot be uploaded to github, but their sources and links are mentioned in corresponding folder
information file.
